Today, I gave an introductory presentation on GrÃ¶bner basis attacks in the context of attacking arithmetization-oriented ciphers.

Couldn't make it?
Not to worry!
Take a peek at [the slides](/blog/2020-08-12_ac_using_gbs.pdf), and complement them by watching [the recording](https://www.bitchute.com/video/aYp4d6gVnFjT/).

Another important piece of the puzzle is FGLM, which is skipped in today's presentation.
[Here](@/blog/2020-10-22_fglm_presentation.md)'s a dedicated presentation about FGLM.
